# Meteor-Dash-Game
In this project I have written a simple 'dodge' game where the player moves left and right to avoid meteorites. I have used pygame in python 3.6 to programme the game and used cx_Freeze to compile it. I am more than willing to show anyone how to use either of these brilliant packages.
